# Machine-Learning
Currently taking a course on Machine Learning through Coursera and Standford University:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome

The code in this repository are Programming Assignments assigned to students taking the course. 
The algorithms codefiles (predict, cost function and any variation of this) are left blank for the students to complete. While others
(loading data, displaying data, plots, submission files) are written by instructors.
Thus the algorithms I wrote can be found in those files.
